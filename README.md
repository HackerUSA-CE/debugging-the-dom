# Troubleshooting with AI

---

## Description

Debugging or troubleshooting a problem is a core skill for all developers. Debugging allows us to find and resolve errors, bugs, or other unexpected behavior. It helps maintain high-quality code by catching issues early in the development process and reduces the need for frequence maintenance and updates.

While looking back at how you did something before that you know works is a valid debugging strategy, let's learn to use AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot to help us solve these errors.
